			The following is a list of books which may be helpful for those seeking additional instruction about core Christian beliefs.  Though this list is nowhere near exhaustive either in topics covered or in the books underneath each topic, and though Gospel of Grace Church does not fully endorse everything taught in each book, we hope this reading list will aide you in living a more Christ-centered, God-glorifying life.
