		<p>First, we would like to make it clear that we welcome everyone to our church.  You don't have to be a member, and you don't have to be baptized.  You can be a skeptic, a seeker, simply curious, or someone who believes differently on some issues yet enjoys the worship and people here best.  You are welcome!</p>

		<p>We believe there is an "Invisible Church" and a "Visible Church".  Only God knows all the members of the Invisible Church.  The Visible Church is easier for us as people to see.  These are the people who are identifying with a local church through baptism and membership.  We believe the Bible clearly teaches baptism and also being identified with a local group of believers whenever that is possible. </p>

		<p>One other comment that should be made:  Everyone in the Invisible Church will eventually go to be with the Lord eternally, but not everyone in the Visible Church will--sometimes non-Christians join the Visible Church even though they have no relationship with Jesus Christ.  Although this may seem rather confusing, as we watch people and their lives, it becomes easier to understand and make sense of what sometimes happens.  It is also a reason for humble acknowledgement that we each rely totally on the grace of God.  </p>
