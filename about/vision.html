	<h1>Gospel of Grace Church <br> Vision & Priority Statement</h1>

	<p class = "largeBegin">The Vision of Gospel of Grace Church:</p>

	<p>
		We desire to be a church where God is pleased to glorify Himself through the salvation of sinners (conversion), the transformation of individual believers into the image of Jesus Christ (sanctification), the building up of the body of Christ (corporate identity), and the equipping of the saints for works of ministry (corporate mission). 
	</p>
	<p class = "semiTitle">Notice four aspects of our vision:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Conversion: individual people are saved by God's grace alone, through faith in Jesus Christ. </li>
		<li>Sanctification: individual believers, through the work of the Holy Spirit inside them, are transformed into the image of Jesus Christ.</li>
		<li>Corporate Identity: individual believers are joined to the church, being knit together in committed love.</li>
		<li> Corporate Mission: the whole church is equipped to serve, each member according to their gifts, in ministries of word (counseling; encouragement; teaching; evangelizing) and deed (genuine love for one another; vocations; social justice).</li>
	</ol>

	<p>In order to accomplish this vision, Gospel of Grace Church is committed to the following priorities:</p>

	<p class = "semiTitle">Preaching the gospel</p>

	<p>
		Preaching the gospel is proclaiming the good news of what God has done, is doing, and will do, in the Person and work of Jesus Christ, <i data-verse="Colossians 1:28." class=" verse fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> primarily through His cross, <i data-verse="1 Corinthians 1:23; 2:2" class=" verse fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> to reconcile fallen sinners to Himself and create on earth a people for His own possession set apart to do good works.  The gospel is most necessary for both unbelievers and believers: It is most necessary for unbelievers to be converted, for they cannot believe in Him of whom they have never heard; <i data-verse="Romans 10:14." class=" verse fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> it is most necessary for sustaining and equipping believers, for Paul wrote, “I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand, and by which you are being saved…” <i data-verse="1 Corinthians 15:1-2." class=" verse fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>  Therefore we exposit the infallible Word of God each week, proclaiming the good news of the truths contained within for the conversion of sinners and edification of saints.  
	</p>

	<p class = "semiTitle">Administering the sacraments of Baptism and the Lord's Supper</p>

	<p>
		Jesus Christ commanded the church to administer the sacraments of Baptism <i data-verse="Matthew 28:19." class=" verse fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> and the Lord's Supper <i data-verse="1 Corinthians 11:23-26." class=" verse fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> until the end of the age when He comes again.  Therefore we administer these two sacraments in obedience to His command for the upbuilding of the saints.
	</p>

	<p class = "semiTitle">Prayer</p>
	<p>
		The body of Christ is called to ceaseless prayer. <i data-verse="Acts 2:42; Colossians 4:2; 1 Thessalonians 5:17." class=" verse fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>  Spiritual leaders must pray for those they lead; <i data-verse="Romans 1:8; Ephesians 1:16; Philippians 1:3-4; Colossians 1:3; 1 Thessalonians 1:2; 2 Thessalonians 1:3." class=" verse fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> believers must pray for those who lead them spiritually; <i data-verse="Ephesians 6:19; 1 Thessalonians 5:25; 2 Thessalonians 3:1; Hebrews 13:18" class=" verse fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> and all believers must pray for each other, <i data-verse="Acts 4:24-31; Ephesians 6:18." class=" verse fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> for all people, <i data-verse="1 Timothy 2:1." class=" verse fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> and for civil authorities.<i data-verse="1 Timothy 2:2." class=" verse fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> 
	</p>

	<p class = "semiTitle">Church Discipline</p>
	<p>
		Church discipline is a painful but most necessary part of the church's life, instituted by our Lord Jesus Christ and further explained and applied by the apostle Paul. 
		<i data-verse="Matthew 16:19 emphasizes the authority of church discipline. </br> Matthew 18:15-20 emphasizes the process of church discipline. </br> 1 Corinthians 5:1-13 emphasizes the reasons for church discipline. </br> 2 Corinthians 2:5-11 emphasizes the goal of church discipline: the restoration of the sinner.  Other passages which give evidence of church discipline: </br> Acts 20:28-31; Romans 16:17-18; Galatians 6:1; Ephesians 5:11; 2 Thessalonians 3:14-15; 1 Timothy 1:20; 5:20; Titus 1:10-11; 3:10; Revelation 2:14-16,20." class=" verse fas fa-external-link-alt">	</i> 
		 It is a shepherding ministry of the church <i data-verse="1 Peter 5:1-5." class=" verse fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> designed by God for the repentance and restoration of the wayward, the protection of the church, and the glory of God. 
	</p>

	<p class = "semiTitle">Communion of the Saints</p>
	<p>
		Christian fellowship is both a blessing and a duty of believers united to the body of Christ, and is most necessary for the worship of God and the edification of each other; therefore Gospel of Grace Church:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Strongly encourages her members to worship God at our regular Sunday meetings, “not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some.” <i data-verse="Hebrews 10:25." class=" verse fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> </li>
		<li>
			Stongly encourages her members to faithfully perform the duties owed other saints, duties such as speaking the truth in love; <i data-verse="Ephesians 4:15." class=" verse fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> encouraging one another and building one another up, <i data-verse="1 Thessalonians 5:11." class=" verse fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> even every day; <i data-verse="Hebrews 3:13." class=" verse fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> admonishing the idle, encouraging the fainthearted, helping the weak; <i data-verse="1 Thessalonians 5:14." class=" verse fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> loving each other genuinely, earnestly, and tenderheartedly, with brotherly affection; <i data-verse="Romans 12:10; Ephesians 4:32; Hebrews 13:1; 1 Peter 4:8." class=" verse fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> bearing with each other patiently, contributing to each other's needs, showing hospitality to one another without grumbling; <i data-verse="1Acts 4:34-35; Romans 12:13; 1 Peter 4:9." class=" verse fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> living in harmony with one another; seeking reconciliation for broken relationships; <i data-verse="Matthew 5:23-24." class=" verse fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>  forgiving one another as God in Christ forgave you; <i data-verse="Matthew 6:12; Ephesians 4:32." class=" verse fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> and being like-minded with each other, counting others more significant than ourselves, and avoiding factions and cliquishness. <i data-verse="1 Corinthians 1:10-13; Philippians 2:2-4." class=" verse fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>  
		</li>
		<li>Makes available Sunday school classes and community groups to study things pertaining to the Word of God and thereby promote fellowship and edification of one another.</li>
	</ol>

	<p class = "semiTitle">Education</p>
	<p>
		The church is the pillar and buttress of the truth; <i data-verse="1 Timothy 3:15." class=" verse fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> therefore Gospel of Grace Church equips the saints for the work of ministry by means of teaching the truths of God's Word <i data-verse="1 Timothy 4:13." class=" verse fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> in worship, Sunday school classes, community groups, and other classes led by qualified teachers <i data-verse="1 Timothy 4:16; 2 Timothy 2:15; James 3:1." class=" verse fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> in accordance with the word of God. <i data-verse="2 Timothy 4:2; Titus 2:3,8." class=" verse fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>   
	</p>

	<p class = "semiTitle">Mission</p>
	<p>
		Jesus Christ has sent the church into all creation to make disciples of all nations. <i data-verse="Mark 16:15; Matthew 28:19." class=" verse fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>   Therefore Gospel of Grace Church is committed to equipping and encouraging believers to evangelize the lost among our families, friends, co-workers, neighbors, and other acquaintances, and to warmly welcoming outsiders and newcomers into our midst.  In addition to spreading the gospel locally, we support, as much as we are able, the spread of the gospel in other locations sacrificially, <i data-verse="2 Corinthians 8:2-3." class=" verse fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> willingly, <i data-verse="2 Corinthians 8:4; Philippians 4:15." class=" verse fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> prayerfully, financially, <i data-verse="1 Corinthians 16:1-3" class=" verse fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> personally, and perpetually. <i data-verse="Romans 15:26-27; Philippians 4:16." class=" verse fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>
