	<p class = "largeBegin">Why are there children in the worship service?  Doesn't your church have a special children's program for them?</p>
	<p>
		The Bible teaches that parents are to instruct and train their children (Deut. 6:7; Proverbs 29:17; Ephesians 6:4), so as a church we attempt to support and assist (not replace) parents in that role.  In order to facilitate this, we invite children to stay in the worship service and participate as they are able.
	</p>

	<p class = "largeBegin">How can a young child understand what is going on?</p>
	<p>
		The Bible talks about children asking parents questions about God (Exodus 12:26; Deut. 6:20), and the parents explaining and teaching (Exodus 12:27; Deut. 6:21-25).  A child's presence in worship often provokes them to ask questions about God, sin, and Jesus Christ, giving parents and teachers opportunity to speak to the children about the gospel.  
	</p>

	<p class = "largeBegin">Do the children ever disrupt the service? </p>
	<p>
		Yes, indeed.  We assume that a child unfamiliar with or unprepared to sit through an hour long service will most likely cause disruptions during the service.  In order to assist parents through such disruptions, parents are encouraged to walk in and out of our worship services at any time.  There are rocking chairs at the back, and also an area with speakers (that usually work) just ouside the sanctuary so parents can continue to listen to the service.  After a time of "encouragement and training" many children are able to sit still and learn about the Christian faith during the worship service.  But in the meantime, while parents are in the process of training children to participate in worship, we bless and thank God for their presence and little voices. 
	</p>

	<p class = "largeBegin">I've noticed a lot of families with younger children sit toward the back.  Is that planned? </p>
	<p>
		Yes, the back rows of the church are ideal for children.  Most parents with smaller children like to sit where they can easily “escape” with a child if need be, and where younger children can move around during worship without distracting others. 
	</p>

	<p class = "largeBegin">It is easier to send my children to a program during worship instead of having them with me.  Isn't having children in worship putting too much emphasis on them? </p>
	<p>
		We agree having children in worship is a lot of work and can be distracting to other worshipers.  We also agree wholeheartedly that it is sinful and wrong (idolatry) to put too much emphasis on children.  Having acknowledged these realities, the reason we invite children into worship is because they were present in the worship services of the early church (Ephesians 6:1).  Just as we desire people from all tongues, tribes, and nations  to come to faith in Jesus Christ and worship Him, so too we desire the church's children to come to faith in Jesus Christ and worship Him.  So, in the hope that God would graciously regenerate the children by means of their hearing and believing the gospel, we invite them into the worship service.   
	</p>

	<p class = "largeBegin">With all this emphasis on parents training up their children, is Gospel of Grace Church a "homeschool" church? </p>
	<p>
		No.  We have families with children in private school, in public school, and in home school.  Our vision is to be a Christ-centered church bringing the gospel to our community; therefore we have no stance or preferred method for schooling children: methods of schooling children are not our concern.  We believe it is solely the parent's responsibility to decide how and where their child(ren) should be educated.  So, whether parents choose private schools, public schools, the home, or another option for educating their children matters not to our church; this is an area of Christian freedom, each believer free to make their own decision according to their conscience.
