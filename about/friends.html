	<div class = "friendsSection">
		Our group is very diverse, both in age range and in interests, so we're sure you'll fit in well!

		On Sunday mornings, many like to arrive early at 10:30 for coffee, cookies, and a time for chatting before our classes start at 11:00.  It's an enjoyable time to get to know each other better.  Visitors are always welcome!

		Staying in touch with what is going on in each other's lives is important to us.  That is how we can know how to support and pray for each other...and who doesn't need a little support and prayer every once in awhile?
	</div>
	<div class = "friendsSection">
		We also have many ongoing activities that aren't listed on this website, but are always listed in our weekly bulletin.  So come visit us on Sunday, read the back of the bulletin, and join right in!

		No one in our group is perfect, as you will learn.  But we do our best to keep our eyes focused on The One who is, and that makes all the difference!
