	<h1>Worship</h1>

	<p>
		Our services are simple and traditional, encouraging faith and confidence in Christ, growth in knowledge, and love for each other.  In essence, we believe that congregational worship is a dialogue with God: God speaks to us through the reading and preaching of his Word; we respond with repentance and joy through singing and prayer.  
	</p>

	<p>Here is a brief explanation of just three components in our worship:</p>

	<h2>Music</h2>

	<p>	In addition to our belief that worship music lyrics should accurately reflect biblical truths, we also believe that our musical worship should be: </p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
				<span class = "largeBegin">Relevant: </span>
				Oh sing to the LORD a new song (Psalm 96:1); Sing to the LORD a new song (Psalm 149:1).
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				<span class = "largeBegin">Thankful: </span>
				Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God (Col. 3:16); 
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				<span class = "largeBegin">Exuberant: </span>
				Play skillfully on the strings, with loud shouts (Psalm 33:3); Shout to God with loud songs of joy! (Psalm 47:1). 
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				<span class = "largeBegin">Cheerful: </span>
				Is anyone cheerful?  Let him sing praise (James 5:13).
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				<span class = "largeBegin">From the heart: </span>
				Be filled with the Spirit...singing and making melody to the Lord with your heart (Eph. 5:19).
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				<span class = "largeBegin">Variegated: </span>
			 	Let the word of Christ dwell in your richly, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs (Col. 3:16); Be filled with the Spirit, addressing on another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs (Ephesians 5:18-19).
			 </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p> 
				<span class = "largeBegin">Glorifying to God: </span>
				Ascribe to the LORD the glory due his name (Ps. 29:2); Let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God...the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name (Hebrews 13:15).
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Prayer</h2>
	<p>
		Though one person leads the congregation in prayer, that person is not praying his own private prayer but praying on behalf of the entire congregation.  This is a time when we knit our hearts together and pray along with the prayer leader.  This prayer is usually composed of Adoration, Confession, Thanksgiving, and Supplication (ACTS), where we adore God (Romans 11:33-36; Ephesians 3:20-21), confess our sins and need for mercy (1 John 1:8-10; Hebrews 4:16), thank him for all his marvelous work (Colossians 1:3; Philemon 1:4) and ask him for various needs (Matthew 6:11-13; Ephesians 3:16-19).  We pray to God not because we think ourselves worthy to be heard on our own merits; rather, we pray to God with boldness and confidence because Jesus Christ has provided us access to the Father (Ephesians 3:12; Hebrews 14-16).  
	</p>

	<h2>Preaching</h2>
	<p>
		The Apostle Paul sums up the central message of preaching in two words: We preach Christ crucified (1 Corinthians 1:23).  No less than in the Apostles' day, today's preaching must confront people with Jesus Christ and his crucifixion (often called the gospel or good news) in order to bring them to repentance and faith and feed their souls.  Preaching which merely assumes or excludes Jesus Christ and his Cross leaves Christians starving and non-Christians lost. 
	</p>
	<p>
		You might be asking, If the central message is the same, doesn't preaching become boring after a while?  No (or at least it shouldn't).  Preaching which gets to the Cross through a variety of biblical texts is a soul-nourishing adventure.  In leading us to the Cross, each biblical text takes a different route on its way.  Thus, though we know where the sermon should land (the Cross), each sermon takes a different path towards the Cross.  And once at the Cross, the personal applications of each text open wide.  
	</p>
	<p>
		Also, it is important to locate the power of preaching.  It is one thing to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ crucified; it is quite another for people to become converted and nourished by this preaching.  Preaching itself is not a magic wand.  Without the work of the Holy Spirit changing our hearts with the gospel, preaching is entirely vain and will accomplish nothing.
