						<p>
							Thanks so much for visiting Gospel of Grace's web site. A word of introduction would be
						in order. That is a bit of a challenge, though. There are so many ways we could introduce
						ourselves to you. We could introduce ourselves by explaining to you what we believe. If we
						would do such, we likely would speak of our being a Christian, Reformed and Presbyterian
						church. That might mean something to you or it might not. To get a good idea of how these
						three words describe us, you might want to visit our <a href="/newWebsite/about/#beliefs">Belief page</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							We could introduce ourselves to you by how we worship our Lord. If you are familiar
						with conservative Presbyterian churches, you know that how we worship is very important to
						us. We believe in the regulative principle of worship. To put it simply, on the one hand, we do
						nothing which Scripture forbids us to do in worshipping our Lord. Many churches would agree
						with us on this point. But we add one further wrinkle that is a bit more unique to us. We only
						do those things which the Scripture commands us to do. By keeping our services within these
						two boundary lines, we believe our worship is biblically sound and honoring to our Lord. For
						more about how we worship, please visit our <a href="/newWebsite/about/#worship">Worship page</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							We could and certainly should introduce ourselves to you on a more personal level. We
						are not just a set of beliefs, a church polity or a way of worshipping our Lord. We are also a
						community of believers who strive to love the Lord and each other. While we place a strong
						emphasis upon sound doctrine, we also emphasize the need to live out our beliefs in our day to
						day lives. We make it our goal, then, to glorify the Lord in our conduct and speech. For more
						information about our little community, please see the <a href="/newWebsite/about/#makingFriends">Making Friends</a> and <a href="/newWebsite/about/#forFamilies">For Families page</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							Well, there is only so much a web site can do to introduce one person to another.
						However much technology advances, it will never replace personal encounter when it comes to
						getting to know one another. So, we invite you to come and meet us in person. For more
						information about further contacting us or for directions to our church, please see the <a href="/newWebsite/contact">Contact
						Us</a> page or <a href="#directions">Driving Directions</a>. We so do appreciate your taking the time to visit our web
						page.
